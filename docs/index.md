# RmmbrIt
## Your memory's backup drive.
Store all the things you need to remember in one place.

Find yourself forgetting where you put something? Can't remember the thing you need to buy that you only need a few times a year? RmmbrIt can solve the problem.
Some common examples of things we've forgotten:
- Furnace filter size, brand, and/or quality
- Car taillight I need to buy. And headlight.
- Light bulb type my kitchen lights use.
- Location of stored items (closet, crawlspace, storage unit, attic)

Did you take a picture of the thing but can't find it? Buried alongside thousands of other pictures? You can add images too!

Add the things you need to remember and easily find them later. Add text, pictures, descriptions, tags, whatever you need. All searchable when you need to remember it.
